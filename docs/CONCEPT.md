# Terrarium: The Concept

## What Is This?

Terrarium is a **societal simulation engine**. It's not a game to win—it's a thought experiment to observe.

You create a small world with rules (physics, resources, constraints). You populate it with autonomous agents, each powered by an LLM with their own personality, memories, and beliefs. Then you step back and watch what happens.

Do they cooperate? Compete? Form hierarchies? Share resources? Develop norms? Fight?

The answer isn't programmed. It emerges.

## The Core Question

> Can we observe the organic emergence of social structures, economic patterns, and cultural phenomena by giving agents freedom within constraints?

We don't code markets, hierarchies, or alliances. We give agents needs (hunger, safety, belonging) and capabilities (movement, communication, giving, taking). Then we observe whether markets, hierarchies, and alliances *emerge*.

## Inspirations

**Games & Simulations**
- *Dwarf Fortress*: Deep emergent narratives from simple systems
- *Conway's Game of Life*: Complexity from minimal rules
- *Anno / The Settlers*: Economic simulation and emergence
- *RollerCoaster Tycoon*: Agents with needs navigating a designed world

**Science & Theory**
- *Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel"*: How geography shapes civilization
- *Agent-based modeling*: Computational social science
- *Chaos theory*: Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- *Behavioral economics*: Bounded rationality, heuristics, biases

**Philosophy**
- The invisible hand: Does coordination emerge without central planning?
- Social contract: How do norms and rules form organically?
- Emergence: How do simple rules produce complex behavior?

## The Observer's Role

You are a **scientific god**. You:

1. **Design the world**: Geography, resources, rules
2. **Set initial conditions**: Population, personalities, starting resources
3. **Start the simulation**: Let it run
4. **Observe**: Read logs, analyze patterns, investigate anomalies
5. **Form hypotheses**: "It looks like trade networks are forming"
6. **Test**: Run again with different parameters

You do *not* intervene during the simulation. The whole point is to see what agents do on their own.

## Why LLMs?

Traditional agent-based models use simple rules: "if hungry, seek food." This produces predictable, mechanical behavior.

LLM-powered agents have:
- **Natural language**: They can communicate in speech, negotiate, persuade, deceive
- **Personality**: Consistent behavioral tendencies shaped by prompting
- **Memory**: They remember what happened to them and form beliefs
- **Reasoning**: They can weigh options and make non-trivial decisions

This doesn't make them human. But it makes them more interesting than rule-based automatons.

## What Might Emerge?

We don't know. That's the point. But possibilities include:

| Phenomenon | How it might look |
|------------|-------------------|
| Trade networks | Repeated, reciprocal exchange between same agents |
| Property norms | Agents avoid taking from "claimed" areas |
| Hierarchies | Asymmetric deference (some agents lead, others follow) |
| Alliances | Coordinated action, mutual defense |
| Reputation | Agents treat others based on third-party information |
| Division of labor | Specialization based on location or skill |
| Conflict patterns | Violence triggered by scarcity or personality clashes |
| Cultural beliefs | Shared causal beliefs ("generosity brings luck") |

## What This Is Not

**Not a prediction engine.** Results don't prove how human societies work. They show how *one possible* system works under specific conditions.

**Not a game.** There's no winning or losing. There's observing and learning.

**Not AI consciousness.** Agents are not aware. They're pattern-matching on prompts. But they're interesting pattern-matchers.

**Not a product.** This is research. Exploration. Experimentation.

## The Scientific Mindset

Approach this like an experiment:

1. **Hypothesis**: "Scarcity will increase conflict"
2. **Design**: Create a low-resource scenario
3. **Run**: Simulate 100 epochs
4. **Observe**: Did conflict increase? Why or why not?
5. **Iterate**: Adjust parameters, run again

Don't cherry-pick results. Don't anthropomorphize beyond what's warranted. Don't mistake the map for the territory.

The value is in generating intuitions and hypotheses—not proving theorems.

## Getting Started

Start small. 10 agents. 100 epochs. Read the chronicle. Did anything interesting happen?

If yes, you're onto something.
If no, tweak the parameters and try again.

The simulation is a tool for thinking. Use it.
